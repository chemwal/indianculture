    <h1>Introduction to Indian Culture</h1>
    <p>
      Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or are associated with the
      ethno-linguistically diverse India. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories
      are
      strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast
      Asia.
      India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from place to place within the
      country.

      Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has been influenced by a history that is
      several
      millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley civilization and other early cultural areas. Many elements of
      Indian
      culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music and movies have had a
      profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India, and the world according to Jean Przyluski, there is evidence
      for
      regional influence from Austroasiatic (Mon Khmer) groups on certain cultural and political elements of Ancient
      India,
      which may have arrived together with the spread of rice cultivation from Mainland Southeast Asia. An ethnic
      minority
      in
      Eastern India is still speaking Austroasiatic languages, most notably the Munda languages. The further influenced
      Indian
      culture, such as through the widespread introduction of the English language, and a local dialect developed.
