      India is a land of rich culture and heritage where people have humanity, tolerance, unity, secularism, strong
      social
      bond, and other good qualities. Indians are always famous for their mild and gentle behaviour, in spite of lots of
      aggressive activities by the people of other religions. Indian people are always praised for their caring and calm
      nature without any change in their principles and ideals. India is a land of great legends where great people took
      birth
      and did lots of social work. They are still inspiring personalities to us.

      India is a land where Mahatma Gandhi took birth and had given a great culture of Ahimsa. He always told us not to
      fight
      with others. Instead, talk to them politely if you really want to get a change in something. He told us that all
      people
      on this earth are hungry for love, respect, care, and honour; if you give them all, they will definitely follow
      you.

      Gandhi Ji always believed in the Ahimsa, and really he became successful a day in getting freedom for India from
      British
      rule. He told Indians to show their power of unity and gentleness and then see the change. India is not a country
      of men
      and women, castes and religions, etc., separately. However, it is a country of unity where people of all castes
      and
      creeds live together conjointly.

      People in India are modern and follow all the changes according to the modern era; however, they are still in
      touch with
      their traditional and cultural values. India is a spiritual country where people believe in spiritualism. People
      here
      believe in Yoga, meditation, and other spiritual activities. Indiaâ€™s social system is great; people still live in
      a big
      joint family with grandparents, uncle, aunt, chacha, tau, cousins, brothers, sister, etc. So, people here learn
      about
      their culture and tradition from birth.
