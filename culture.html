    <p class="para_culture">India has 28 states and 8 union territories with different cultures and is the most
      populated country in the world. The
      Indian culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several various cultures, spans across the Indian subcontinent
      and
      has been influenced and shaped by a history that is several thousand years old. Throughout the history of India,
      Indian
      culture has been heavily influenced by Dharmic religions. Influence from East/Southeast Asian cultures onto
      ancient
      India and early Hinduism, specifically Austroasiatic groups, such as early Munda and Mon Khmer, but also Tibetic
      and
      other Tibeto-Burmese groups, had noteworthy impact on local Indian peoples and cultures. Several scholars, such as
      Professor Przyluski, Jules Bloch, and Lévi, among others, concluded that there is a significant cultural,
      linguistic,
      and political Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic) influence on early India, which can also be observed by Austroasiatic
      loanwords
      within Indo-Aryan languages and rice cultivation, which was introduced by East/Southeast Asian
      rice-agriculturalists
      using a route from Southeast Asia through Northeast India into the Indian subcontinent. They have been credited
      with
      shaping much of Indian philosophy, literature, architecture, art and music. Greater India was the historical
      extent of
      Indian culture beyond the Indian subcontinent. This particularly concerns the spread of Hinduism, Buddhism,
      architecture, administration and writing system from India to other parts of Asia through the Silk Road by the
      travelers
      and maritime traders during the early centuries of the Common Era. To the west, Greater India overlaps with
      Greater
      Persia in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains. Over the centuries, there has been a significant fusion of cultures
      between Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Sikhs and various tribal populations in India.<br><br>
      Indian-origin religions Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, are all based on the concepts of dharma and
      karma.
      Ahimsa, the philosophy of nonviolence, is an important aspect of native Indian faiths whose most well known
      proponent
      was Shri Mahatma Gandhi, who used civil disobedience to unite India during the Indian independence movement – this
      philosophy further inspired Martin Luther King Jr. during the American civil rights movement. Foreign-origin
      religion,
      including Abrahamic religions, such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam, are also present in India, as well as
      Zoroastrianism and Baháʼí Faith both escaping persecution by Islam have also found shelter in India over the
      centuries.
      <br><br>
      India is the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and other religions. They are collectively known
      as
      Indian religions. Indian religions are a major form of world religions along with Abrahamic ones. Today, Hinduism
      and
      Buddhism are the world's third and fourth-largest religions respectively, with over 2 billion followers
      altogether, and
      possibly as many as 2.5 or 2.6 billion followers. Followers of Indian religions – Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and
      Buddhists
      make up around 80–82% population of India.
